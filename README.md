# memory-cache

Experiments with key-value cache (in memory) management.

## Roadmap

- [x] It's a **must-have** be possible to write and retrieve data
- [ ] It's a **should-have** be possible to set a lifetime for a key
- [ ] It's a **could-have** be possible to have events and define hooks to then
- [ ] It's a **could-have** be possible to get the total size of the store (in bytes)
  - [ ] It's a **must-have** be possible to turn off this (because this feature can affect performance)
  - (I can think in two logical solutions to this feature, how could I compare then?)
